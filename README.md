# SmartNitro Reseller
A Discord Bot used to resell credits from dash.nxyy.shop, using it's API.

## Setup
1. Download and install Python 3.9 or a more recent version.
2. Download this repo and install dependancies (`pip install -r requirements.txt`).
3. Setup your config in config.yml
4. If you don't want to use English, replace lang.yml with your language found in the `langs` folder.
5. Run using `python main.py`

## Updating
To update the bot: 
1. Download the new version as a zip, and extract it to a new folder.
2. Copy your old config into the new folder, but have it as a different name.
3. Compare the two configs, and see if there are any new fields/data you need to fill in for the new version.
4. Once everything is filled out, remove the old config, and make sure the name it set to `config.yml`.
5. Copy everything inside of the `data` folder.
6. Restart the bot using `python main.py` or equivalent.

## Languages
If you would like to use a different language for the bot, replace your lang.yml file with your languages file, found in the "langs" folder.

If your language isn't in there, then you will have to translate yourself. We are adding more translations as soon as we can.
